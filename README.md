# TCIO

Testing, calculation, input and output (TCIO) is a C++ program which I programmed to learn C++. <br>
It has no GUI and is only visible through the console. <br>
The program has various functions which get the user input, generate random numbers, read/write from/to a file and print to the console. <br>
It's like a very simple math quiz with error/input handling and many prints to the console.

You can download it if you select the green button named "Code" then "Download ZIP" or download the ZIP file over the releases tab. <br>
Extract the downloaded zip folder and then open the program by opening the .exe file. <br>

Feel free to add a pull request or an issue. I might learn something from it because I am still learning.
